Theo Armour ~ Read Me
======================

## GitHub Presence
You have two ways of viewing my files here on GitHub:  

* Hosted pages on GitHub: [theo-armour.github.io]( http://theo-armour.github.io/ "View the files as apps." ) <input value="<< You are now probably here." size=28 style="font:bold 12pt monospace;border-width:0;" >  
* Source code on GitHub: [github.com/theo-armour]( https://github.com/theo-armour "View the files as source code." )  <scan style=display:none ><< You are now probably here.</scan>

## &#x2766; Links to Some of My GitHub Projects
Most of my work is kept in repositories that are [GitHub organization accounts]( https://github.com/blog/674-introducing-organizations "Thanks, GitHub" ).  

<input value="&#x261A; Click the menu items to see overviews for the projects." size=60 style="font:bold 12pt monospace;border-width:0;" >  

[Github organization accounts]( https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-organization-account--2 ) make it easy to collaborate. 
My contributions to open-source repositories on GitHub include the following projects:
			
* [jaanga.github.io]( http://jaanga.github.io ) ~ a GitHub repository with a number of projects. [source]( http://github.com/jaanga ).
* [aechack.github.io]( http://aechack.github.io ) ~ Team aeChack's entry, AEC Hackathon, 2013-11-8/10, Facebook HQ, Menlo Park CA. [source]( http://github.com/aechack/aeChack.github.io )
* [fgx.github.io]( http://fgx.github.io )  ~ addons for [FlightGear]( http://www.flightgear.org/ ) the open source flight simulator. [source]( http://github.com/fgx ).
* [absence.github.io]( http://absence.github.io ) ~  a summary of an important book. [source]( http://github.com/absence ).	
* [patterns-dev.github.io]( http://patterns-dev.github.io ) ~ an outline of <i>A Pattern Language</i>. [source]( http://github.com/patterns-dev ).

## Notes 

### Two links for each repository
Most people use and think of GitHub as a wonderful repository for computer source code. 
GitHub, however, also provides a free and very powerful web site hosting services via their [GitHub Pages]( http://pages.github.com/ "Thank you, GitGub!" ) feature.
This feature only works for static files - such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, text and image files. 
Since these are the only files types I deal with, GitHub hosting is delightful hosting solution.

Thus for almost all the work I do you will see two links. One goes to the web page or app hosted by GitHub. 
The other link points you to the source code for the page or app.

### Write once, read many
In order to be as effective and efficient as possible, the goal is to write content once and have it appear as required or as necessary in either app or source code or both.
GitHub source repositories support the display of files in [Markdown]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown ) format: every Markdown file is displayed as HTML.

A current effort is to use these Markdown files in both the source code repositories and web page hosting.
So, for example, the web pages at theo-armour.github.io are written in HTML but each page calls up a Markdown file 
that is used to populate the right-side content panel of each page.  

### Intuitiveness needed
Apps are from Venus. Code is from Mars. Much time in producing the above sites and text is being devoted 
to the process of developing effective terminology and user experience for bridging the gap between apps and source, between gitHub.io and github.com. 

This process will be discussed and dissected in more detail in the fullness of time.

### Fonts
These web pages call for the use of the default monospace font as designateed by your browser. In most situations this ends us as the '[Courier]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_(typeface) )' typeface.
This is not standard practice. Most web pages call for a proprtionally spaced font. Why the unusual practice? Most of my work is aimed at coders and progammers who are interested in design.
Programmers and coders work with monospace fonts. So I design my sites to appear in a programmatic or coderly way.

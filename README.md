Hello

Deprecated. This repository is one for the history books. It is a reminder that whatever we want to do may take time and care and patience. And then it is over. And then we go on to whatever is next. Nonetheless, it remains alive, available and reviewable.

Below are links to some of my more recent efforts:

This is the eleventh significant update to theo-armour.github.io. None of them have been much good because I'm almost always anywhere but here.

Here is a snapshot of what I - and some of my friends - have been playing with:

[GubGub for Theo Armour]( https://pushme-pullyou.github.io/gubgub )



## mission


Thinking out loud as I put the package together:

* I am a README file. Read me files are the documentation - and the marketing - for huge portions of modern technology. You can know more about me more quickly just by reading my read me files, They are an active and on-going journal of most of my activities.

* Eat your own dog food. If you call yourself a coder, then you should have a web site and code it yourself. If that's too difficult or would take too long then you can't really call yourself an effective coder, can you?

* Be 'you'sful. The web site you build should be useful to you. If web site is not that useful to you in some way, then why should it be useful to anybody else?

* Self-marketing code. I want my coding to do its own marketing. I don't want to switch back and forth during the day between a marketing and coding roles. I think a good use of the GitHub API to generate fun reports automatically will help make my sites fun for users and authors.

* Small is beautiful. Building lots of small projects that work together creates fewer bugs, gets code out faster - and is more fun to play with.

* Starting again from scratch today is a lot more fun than trying to figure out what you wrote yesterday.

* Snippets of code. I would be lost without my snippets.

* Easy Peasy Pleasey. Writing code for beginners is a good thing. If you can explain it to a student, then why go further?

* Self-garbage collecting. When we talk about about cleaning up the memory on a computer, we call it 'garbage collection'. We humans need to do it too. We need to erase all the established practices, well-known 'gotchas' ans rules-of-thumb. Contemporary computing is moving so fast that every thing we do from habit can and should be questioned. Those who code from history are doomed.

* Just-in-time-Learning

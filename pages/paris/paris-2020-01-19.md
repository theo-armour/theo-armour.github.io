# [Paris]( index.html )

2020-01-19

_This is more about tips, tricks and hacks than about what to do._

## History

Who called it [_Lutetia_]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutetia )? The Romans did.


## Communicating

Bring a GSM phone with you and purchase a pre-paid phone chip with cheap data plan almost anywhere

Most [everywhere in Paris]( https://www.france-travel-guide.net/free-wifi-in-paris.html ) has free WiFi for two hours with paris-wifi.

Note that the 'FreeWifi' service is not free.



## Dates to remember

June 21. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%AAte_de_la_Musique


## Transport

Learn to Velib. Your credit card has no chip? Not to worry: http://en.velib.paris.fr/

Stoplights are not where they are meant to be, so you don’t know where to stop, do you?

A vehicle to the right of your automobile has unmitigated and total right of way (_priorité à droite_)

Know where your taxi stand (_tête de station_) is located.

What is the number or app for Taxi Bleu? Have a look at http://www.taxis-bleus.com/

Wherever you are in Paris, one of the 245 metro stations is within 500 meters of where you re standing.

On New Year's Eve, _Fête de la Musique_, _Nuit Blanche_ and other events, some stations on Lines 1, 4, 6, 9 and 14 remain open all night.

_What about Uber, Lyft and others?_


## Things to see and do

Paris has [many more circuses]( https://en.parisinfo.com/what-to-do-in-paris/info/guides/going-to-the-circus-in-paris "The capital has several big tops and other venues where you can discover circus arts with the family" ) than most cities.

There is one of the ~[163 museums in Paris]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_museums_in_Paris) close by to almost anywhere.

* Musée Rodin on a sunny day. Great outdoor statue museum.
* Musée d'Orsay for a beautiful building by the Seine and a great collection of impressionist art.
* Musée Beaubourg for modern art and a great permanent collection (Picasso, dada, surrealism..).

Boats are for exploring sewers, the Seine and canals.

The [Catacombs]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catacombs_of_Paris ) are truly scary.

Where did Ravel compose “Bolero”: http://www.maurice-ravel.net/belved.htm

Go see Jean Tinguely’s “Cyclops”. https://www.lecyclop.com/

Visit a cemetary

Fun streets to walk during the day:

* rue mouffetard,
* rue de Seine,
* rue du faubourg st Denis

Fun streets to walk at night;

* rue de la roquette,
* rue mouffetard.



If you're only in paris for a few days and it's your first visit there, I would limit big day trips like Versailles, [Giverney]( http://fondation-monet.com/en/ ), [Compiegne]( https://chateaudecompiegne.fr/ ) or Reims to just one (or none).

Challenge: there are multiple smaller versions of the Statue of Liberty in Paris. Can you find at least two?

## Sunday

Everything closes on Sunday. Except in the 4th arrondissement, where everything closes on Saturday and opens on Sunday.

On Sunday, somewhere in your arrondissement, there is a pharmacy and a boulanger that opens at least briefly.

Sunday is for parks, the Champs Elysées [beware the pickpocket] and visiting people.


## Geography



Your arrondissement is divided into _quartiers_. Learn their four names. Wonder if you are living in the French Quarter.

There are twenty _arrondissements_ in Paris. Learn that the _arrondissements_ are laid out as a clockwise spiral starting from, doh, the Louvre.

Every arrondissement has a swimming pool and a town hall where fun stuff happens.

The closer you are to the 1st arrondissement, the thinner and better-dressed the people are. The further away you go, the easier it is to find parking spaces.


## Socializing

When you kiss, the head moves to the left on the first kiss. Always.

The only people you don’t shake hands with are the people you kiss on both cheeks.

Shake hands with everybody, all the time. Especially in your café.

You have to spend a bit of time and effort learning which café is your café, but once you learn which one it is, you will go there twice a day.

Walking. It’s about the walking.

After five days of walking by a café where everybody is looking at you, you start to dress better.


## Eating

Eat in restaurants where the dish of the day is written on a blackboard. Alice Waters learned this trick in Paris.

Order the dish that’s on the blackboard – especially if you have never had it before.

There are three restaurants that are too small to be in any guidebook within walking distance of where you live that prepare simply awesome food. Find them.

Restaurants that serve good food are not hidden behind curtains or walls. You can look inside and see the clientèle.

If the clientèle of a restaurant is attractive to you then you will like the food served there.

As long as they don’t have to cross a street, after several visits with the parents, quite young children may be given the responsibility to fetch the bread from the boulanger in the morning.

Somebody has to get the _baguette_, _ficelle_, _pain au chocolat_, _croissant_ every morning.

Children will learn not to put their fingers on the glass of the display cases at the patissier.

Your children understand how to handle eating at a restaurant. Don’t they?

## Shopping

When you enter the shop you say “Bonjour, Madame.” and "Bonjour, Monsieur". When you leave the shop, you say “Merci, Madame, merci Monsieur".

Even if the person behind the counter is, like, fifteen you still say “Bonjour, Madame.”

On market days, you buy your food at the market.

You buy a hard, a medium and a soft cheese.

You know that there is a proper way to cut each type of cheese. Slicing the cheese incorrectly is vulgar.

Today you buy the food you will eat today. Except for Saturday when you may also buy food for Sunday.

You have a market bag, don’t you?

 Dior, Chanel, Karl Lagerfeld, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy, Christian Lacroix,  Louis Vuitton, Hermés, and Cartier are all visitable.

You are never more than 500 meters from the green cross that indicates ‘pharmacy’. Whatever you need, the pharmacy can supply this afternoon.

Every pharmacie is owned by the pharmacist that runs the pharmacy. No chains.

All pharmacies have little kiosks with shelves of little colorful boxes. Ignore these. Walk uo to the person at the counter and start telling them what ails you. After a good discussion they will disappear then return with the box of exactly the right color for your ailment. It's like a restaurant where they tell you what to eat.




## Your AirBnB

What is the [entry code]( https://www.parislogue.com/travel-tips/30-paris-tips-6/ ) for the door?

How many seconds until the light in the hall turns off and you are in the dark?

Who gets to go in the tiny elevator with the suitcases and who has to walk up the stairs?

Where are the garbage bins and what rubbish do you put where on what day?

Where is your closest supermarket for toilet paper and stuff?

The frozen food from [Picard]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard_Surgel%C3%A9s) is not bad at all.



## Whatever

The French use the least amount of soap per capita in Europe [citation needed]. Maybe because a bar of _savon de Marseille_ truly lasts just about forever.

By law, the pharmacist must be able to tell you if the mushroom you have is edible.

In all cafes, all the outdoor chairs face the street. So you can see and be seen.

The kinds of things that are wanted or needed:

* Write once, read anywhere
* Code for dummies
* Lots of images
* Lots of 3D
* Easy to maintain
* Easy to enhance
* Fully utilizes GitHub spirit/features

HTML files are about using the apps  
Moving around github is about looking at source code  
Seamless transitions between viewing apps and viewing source

Moving around should be as easy as changing TV channels.  
You can go to the next channel by clicking.

You never have to go and return, go and return, go and return.

Like a multipane file tree viewer.

100% JavaScript

The problem  
Apps are from Venus. Code is from Mars

Browse appa and code easily.
Each screen shows images of the contents.
Handles folders and files.

_2014-03-17 ~ The following has been cut from the docBrowser read me and brought here.  

The thoughts above and below will eventually be assimilated,_

## Features

_The following are some of the thoughts going on while this app and these web pages are being developed. This text is very much a work in rapid progress._

### Easy to enhance

* Create something that screams: 'tweak me till I twerk.' 'Open up the hood, pick up your wrench and screwdriver, and take me apart.'


### Support Lots of interactive 3D

* If this is 'your 3D happy-place' then the library better be open to luscious interactive 3D


### Support lots of images and videos

Yet:

* Don't forget the handicapped  
* Not everybody has cutting edge technology


### Apps are from Venus. Code is from Mars.

* Two links for every repo - one for app view - one for source view  
* And one for the read me.
* HTML files are about using the apps
* Moving around github is about looking at source code
* Needs seamless transitions between running apps, parsing source code and viewing read me files 


### Embrace GitHub

* Fully utilizes GitHub spirit/features


### Effortless Navigation

* Moving around is as easy as changing TV channels. You can go to the next channel by clicking. Like a multipane file tree viewer.
* You *do not* have have to go and return, go and return, go and return.
* Browse apps and code easily.
* Each screen shows images of the contents
* Handles folders and files

### WORM revisited

* Write once, read anywhere
* A guiding precept is: 'Write once. Read many.'
* This has nothing to to with WORM drives.
* In this case meaning the ability to view files in a well-formatted fashion in either a GitHub source code repository or available as a GitHub-hosted web-page.


### Accept Quantity

* Make it really easy and really fast to look after and curate lots of projects and c=very simple to add new projects.


### Compatibility

* Markdown interpreter 
* Compatible with airDoodle 
* Totally embraces the GitHub thing

### Oriented toward programmers 

* Monospace font
* Left justified
* IDE-like feeling
* Snarky attitude


### Oriented toward Designers / Code is for dummies


### Easy to Maintain

* Lends itself to progressive improvements
* Ability to go through lots of files - one by one - and make incremental improvements that evolve as the improvements are made and then can be easily carried0back to the previously enhanced files.
	- or putting it another way: nothing prevents the above from happening.

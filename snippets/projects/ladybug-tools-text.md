Significant changes at detail design stages are more expensive than changes at preliminary design stages.

Whenever geo-physical elements - such as Sun-control and weather - are significant contributors to a building design,
then awareness of design influencing issues early in the design process may reduce the costs at major changes at later stages.

In order for such input to be useful at early stages is must be generated quickly, cheaply and easily.

When people with considerable geo-physical talent are involved  eat early stages, then the tools mist be able to give them the insites they seek.

When designers with less of a technical background are involved,
the tools should be easy to pick and able to produce reports with meaning and relevance to lay-peeps.

The Ladybug Tools set of apps is designed to help designers make better early stage design decision based on timely, accurate and inexpensive calculations.

* Butterfly: Wind, Architectural Aerodynamics
	* Butterfly is python library to create and execute OpenFOAM cases
	* [OpenFOAM]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenFOAM ) (for "Open source Field Operation And Manipulation") is a C++ toolbox for the development of customized numerical solvers, and pre-/post-processing utilities for the solution of continuum mechanics problems, including [computational fluid dynamics (CFD)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics )
	* Are we [OpenFOAM+]( http://openfoam.com/ ) or [OpenFOAM]( https://openfoam.org/ )?? Anf why?

### Dragonfly
	* https://github.com/chriswmackey/Dragonfly
	* A plugin for climate data generation and manipulation
	* Dragonfly allows users to import several satellite image data sets into Rhino/Grasshopper and warp climate files based on either this satellite data, urban morphology parameters, or future climate change scenarios.
	* The Dragonfly project intends to make many large-scale climate variables accessible to the visual scripting interface of Grasshopper as well as the 3D visualization interface of Rhino.

* Honeybee
	* https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/honeybee
	*  A free and open source Grasshopper3D plugin for building energy and daylighting simulation with connections to
		* EnergyPlus
		* Radiance
		* Daysim
		* OpenStudio
* Ladybug:
	* A Grasshopper3D plugin for environmental analysis
	* imports standard EnergyPlus Weather files (.EPW) in Grasshopper and provides a variety of 2D and 3D designer-friendly interactive graphics to support the decision-making process during the initial stages of design.
	* The tool also provides further support for designers to test their initial design options for implications from radiation and sunlight-hours analyses results.

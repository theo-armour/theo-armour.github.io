“Surgery creates another weakened area and up to 10 percent of abdominal incisions will develop an incisional hernia,” Dr. Sulkowski says.

Current symptoms
* Must lie down every few minutes to let the intestinal protrusion recede
* Almost any activity seems to provoke the commencement of a protrusion
* Being careful reduces painful incidents down to 6/7/8 level occurring just a few times an hour
* Walking several hundred yards with walker is doable

Adaptations
* Carry a phone everywhere
* Zero pushing when defecating
* Be prepared to lie down for a few minutes every twenty minutes
* Until hernia trusses arrive:
	* Whenever possible for a one-handed person: walk with hand pressed against affected region in groin
	* Press stump into affected area when sitting
* Bend down with the knees not with the stomach


Activities
* Phone call with health coordinator: Monday appointment
* Phone call with Lindsay Mann: urgent referral to General Surgery

* RE: Hernia prognosis

As I hope you know, I was admitted to and released from the UCSF ER at Mount Parnassus

After some hours the bulge in my groin dissipated and incidents of great pain ceased.

As of the writing of this message, there have been no further incidents of protrusions. I believe this is because I have been very careful about not contracting or straining muscles in the area.

There is also minor ongoing intermittent pain that occurs occasionally deeper inside and perhaps nearer the scrotum. This is the pain that started six or so weeks ago. Looking at the various images, my guess there's an issue with the spermatic cord (but who am I to know ;-) I note that after my colectomy there was signification edema of the scrotum. In any case it's a pain I can probably live with.

The web pages I have visited include:

* https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2633918


Things I am planning:
* Obtain a inguinal hernia truss tomorrow
* Zero pushing when defecating


As and when the symptoms reoccur, I plan to:
* Lie down, preferably with my butt elevated with a pillow
* Apply ice to the area
* Press down on the bulge with my hand
* Intentionally relax the muscles


Plan of action
* See if I can live the rest of this week without significant re-occurrences of major episodes of protrusions and pain
* If I cannot do so, you will hear me banging on the door the clinic
* If I can keep things under control, I will pat myself on the back

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on my observations. And, given that I am as clueless as any normal  non-medically trained peep, suggesting what actions I actually should be taking.

Hernia prognosis and upcoming ultrasound scan


Thank you for your observations during my recent visit to your office.

My guess that your prognosis that I presented the symptoms of a hernia continue to be accurate.


Since my visit, a bulge of varying size and hardness has manifested itself just under the skin/fat between pubic area and left crease.

It supplements the various pains and tenderness that existed prior.


The pain is intermittent and seems to depend on the hight of a chair and its hardness.
But has just also appeared for no apparent visible cause.


Most any movement causes a 1/2 pain sensation.


On occasion, pain level reaches 7/8/9 for several seconds and can be alleviated by moving leg or body 'out of the area'.

Moving back 'into the area' immediately causes the pain to reoccur.
Pain may be sharp. Alternatively the area may just feel as if it is hot.
While the sharp pain is occurring my life comes to a standstill.


So far, I can cause the pain to cease by lying on my back for five to ten minutes.
I am learning to diminish to onset of high pain by interrupting any activity and lying down prior to the onset.
This also causes the bulge to diminish. Massaging the bulge also appears to cause the bulge to reduce.


Given the above, could you kindly help me with the responding to following questions?


1. Ultrasound scan is scheduled for December 4.
	* Is there any way you know of that this appointment could be rescheduled for an earlier date?
	* Would you be able place a request for sooner scan with Radiology?
2. What steps could I take to alleviate pain and prevent further degradation?
	* What should I do if I am outside and there is no place to lie down? Can you suggest a medication to carry with me?
	* Is massaging beneficial or detrimental? Are there aspects to be considered while massaging?
3. If treatment is suggested/required, what are aspects I should consider?
	* My family is planning a Christmas holiday in Utah, how wary of travel should I be if I am in my current state?
	* Would any procedures be likely to occur before the holidays?
	* If so, would recovery be likely to affect the plans?

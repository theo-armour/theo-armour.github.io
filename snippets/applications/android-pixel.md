## Tips

Double-tap the Recents button to switch right back to the last app you had open.

Long-press the overview button to shrink your current app down to the top/left half of the screen (left half in landscape) and bring up a list of open apps to choose one for the other half.

Remote debugging requires your version of desktop Chrome to be newer than the version of Chrome for Android on your device.
Try using Chrome Canary (Mac/Windows) or the Chrome Dev channel release (Linux) on desktop.

Drag the home button to the left to move between previously open apps

Split Screen
You can still use more than one app at a time on the Pixel 3. Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open multitasking view, then tap on the app icon at the top of the app's card. Select Split Screen followed by the second app you want to use.

Rotation lock
Each time you rotate your phone, a rotation toggle will show up next to the home button. Tap on the button to rotate the display, and then once again when you're ready to go back to portrait mode.

Dark mode
Android Pie 9.0 now comes with a dark mode for the interface. The feature can be enabled all the time, or you can set it so that your wallpaper determines the color of the shortcut and notification shade.

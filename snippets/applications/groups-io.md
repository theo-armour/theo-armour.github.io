## Mailing list


### benefits

The benefits include:

* A permanent record of outbound and inbound messages - all readily accessible to all members old and new
* Multiple owners - avoids the creation of dictators
* Full admin control - exclude trolls etc
* Members can manage their profile, passwords and preferences
* No charge for a basic plan

### Collaboration and communicating

Problem: Not everybody has a slack, trello, whatsapp, jira, telegram, basecamp, twitter, messenger, notion and roam account. And even when they do, they often are not export users.

Solution: Everybody has an email account and knows how to deal with it.

### Groups.io

* Almost as good as a forum
* Handles multiple threads moderately well
* Handles sub-groups very well
* Messages may be formatted using Markdown

### Growth path

Groups.io is fine for the core members of an early-stage organization.

As projects become more complex Groups.io morphs into the way of communicating with dozens, hundred and even larger numbers of members.

At the same time the core team moves its messaging to a GitHub organization

Browser?

[Goodbye, Chrome: Google’s web browser has become spy software]( https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-switch/?utm_term=.bcbed00a5ad2 )

I use https://brave.com/ and am happy so far.

Best regards,

## Brave browser ~ should be good

Good luck with Brave. It should be a fine browser.

The Brave organization was founded by one of my mostly heroes: Brendan Eich. Eich invented the programming language I use for all my work - JavaScript - in ten days. Eich was also a co-founder of Mozilla an Firefox but was asked to leave because he was seen to have donated to an anti-gay marriage movement

Interestingly, the [Brave browser]( https://github.com/brave/brave-browser ) - just like the upcoming versions of the Microsoft Edge browser - is built upon [Chromium]( https://www.chromium.org/ ) an open-source web browser initially and still developed by Google and others. As  they say, you can checkout but you can never leave.

## One of the few matters where I agree with our current president.

> “I do notice that people are declaring more and more fake news, where they go, ‘Fake news!’” the president said during an Oval Office interview with The New York Times. “I even see it in other countries. I don’t necessarily attribute that to me. I think I can attribute the term to me. I think I was the one that started using it, I would say.”

## So what is 'fake news"?

“News stories that have no factual basis but are presented as facts."

Allcott, Hunt; Gentzkow, Matthew (January 2017). "Social Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election." Stanford University, New York University, National Bureau of Economic Research: 5–6.

 “fake news” as those news stories that are false: the story itself is fabricated, with no verifiable facts, sources or quotes.

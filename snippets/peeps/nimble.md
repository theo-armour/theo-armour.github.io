Nimble Scooters make perhaps the greatest urban mobility device on the market today. It's the fast/slow way to get from point A to Point B. Coast by what's beautiful. Zip by the boring. All the time carrying up to 300 pounds of whatever. Zoom down the warehouse aisles. Turn sharp corners at the farmer's market. Mobility that's fleet - just using your feet.

There's a lot more. And it's all visible at Alix's IndieGoGo campaign.

Jump on board!

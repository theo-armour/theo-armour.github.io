### Should Law Subsidize Driving?

My take

* Given a well designed system, running in an optimal state, guided ny intelligent, well meaning people there may still be endemic causes, instances and perpetuation of injustice.

* The cases of Allison Liao and Lauren Davis are not isolated injustices.
It has been shown empirically that vulnerable road users (VRUs) are regularly
blamed for their own deaths.183 After conducting a content analysis of 200 local
news reports of crashes resulting in the deaths of people walking and biking,
researchers concluded that “coverage tends to shift blame toward VRUs and
away from drivers. Coverage almost always treats crashes as isolated incidents,
obscuring the public health nature of the problem.”184 The scholars believe this
“pattern of coverage likely contributes to the limited public outcry about
pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities.”
*  For example, an experienced personal injury lawyer in the
space has stated that the NYPD follows an undocumented but rigid “observed
violation” rule with regard to the law that requires motorists to yield to
pedestrians.209 Under this rule, the police refuse to issue tickets under that law
unless they personally observe a motorist violating it.210 Their stated justification
is that judges would not uphold the citation unless an officer personally
witnessed the incident.211 This rationale is absurd on its face; as the lawyer noted,
it posits that a court would require “a higher quality of proof in order to establish
a traffic violation” than to establish crimes like murder.
* . In most places, street parking is given away free of
charge without regard to the residency or taxpaying status of the user. Further,
street parking is reserved for cars. T
* The objective of central planners in establishing a minimum number of
required spaces is to require private landowners to construct enough space “to
satisfy the peak demand for free parking.”3
* The shift towards light trucks has likely taken the lives of thousands of
additional people who were walking, biking, or using mobility devices to get
around town. Research shows that a pedestrian is 3.4 times as likely to be killed
if struck by an SUV or other light truck than if hit by a passenger car.
*  by motorists (and virtually never the other way around),491 and are often
blamed for their own deaths by police and media casually and without basis, these groups are structurally disadvantaged by a rule that makes them prove the person who killed them did so while failing to exercise due care.
* Say an SUV rolls over while the driver is making a turn, and severely
injures a pedestrian and the driver. Assume that both victims believe this
rollover to have been caused by a design failure of the manufacturer’s making,
but cannot prove this.
Claims for a defective product, such as an automobile, can be advanced
on two similar but distinct grounds. First, the injured party may bring suit in
tort, alleging the product was “not reasonably safe” or, similarly, was
“unreasonably dangerous.” In principle, either victim could bring a tort suit on
these facts. Second, a plaintiff harmed by a defective product may bring a breach
of warranty claim in contract. Under this second option, a plaintiff may charge
that an automobile manufacturer breached an implied or express warranty. The
driver should be able to make this claim against the automobile manufacturer.
A pedestrian who wants to sue a carmaker using the latter strategy,
however, must confront his lack of privity. This requirement bars suits in
contract where a plaintiff was not in a preexisting contractual relationship with
the defendant.502 Thus, under a strict reading of this rule, an innocent bystander
would be unable to sue an automobile manufacturer in contract. The lack of
privity defense has been criticized for removing potential relief for innocent
bystanders, who do not have any way of preventing or avoiding the risks caused
by unsafe products.503 Even though it does not affect his tort claim, the lack of
privity defense may prejudice the pedestrian’s rights in a few material ways.
* The lack of privity defense will systematically restrict the type of plaintiff
who can bring a lawsuit against a car manufacturer for breach of warranty claims
to exclude pedestrians. U.C.C. § 2-318 Alternative A,504 which has been adopted
by a majority of states,505 bars innocent bystanders injured by defective products
from bringing breach of warranty claims because of a lack of privity.506
The test for breach of contract (under an implied warranty of
merchantability) requires only that plaintiff show the product was “not fit for
the ordinary purposes such goods are used.”507 Thus, a plaintiff under a breach
of warranty claim need not show the product was unreasonably dangerous. This
difference can be dispositive.
* Thus, in this case, neither victim has an effective tort remedy, but while the
driver has a contract remedy against the carmaker, the pedestrian does not.
Contract doctrine is not the most natural fit for redressing harms to third
parties who are not intended beneficiaries. Nevertheless, as with insurance
regulation, the operation of tort law, traffic regulation, tax law, and myriad other
fields, in contract it is once again unprotected non-drivers who pay the steepest
price for law’s subsidy to driving.
* The most important subsidy for driving in the criminal law is in the area
of enforcement. Enforcement of laws proscribing striking pedestrians are rarely
enforced, even against hit-and-run motorists who kill their victims.509 In a recent
study, even where motorists killed someone walking or using a wheelchair, they
were charged with some form of homicide less than seven percent of the time.
510
In addition, car-related offenses are frequently defined as violations
while ones relating to transit are crimes or otherwise result in graver
consequences. Examples abound. In the ordinary course, the maximum penalty
for a parking meter or HOV lane violation is a ticket, while boarding a subway
or light rail without paying can trigger not only a fine but arrest.511 Ironically, delaying 50 bus passengers by temporarily parking in the bus lane is punishable
by ticket, but boarding that same bus with an expired pass can trigger jail time.512
Motorists also enjoy more constitutional privacy protection in their car trunks
than people riding the subway or walking down the street with respect to their
person or belongings.513 Given the demographic makeup of the transit user
base,514 the increased legal jeopardy and physical intrusion by law enforcement
to which transit riders are subject cannot be understood without reference to
race.
Finally, even when motorists kill while driving negligently or recklessly,
it can be difficult to secure a jury verdict of homicide. 515 For this reason,
legislatures created a special category of homicide—vehicular manslaughter—
for homicides committed with a car,
516 which is a lesser offense.

Law’s function is not only substantive but expressive, and of course in
the real world these roles feed on each other.
518 Motorists today can make
reckless choices that erase human life secure in the knowledge that they will not
have to face the consequences.

	* Meridian was created by government and industry to focus on key areas of UK capability in the global Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) sector which is predicted to be worth £907 billion by 2035. These include advanced development and validation, connected environments, data and cyber security and new service development.

The elements of the language are entities called patterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

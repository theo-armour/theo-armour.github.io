And you have to start somewhere.

As @greggman point out the viewer examples posted here may not be everyone's cup of tea. 

On the other hand they mostly appear to be working and do offer new visualization paradigms.

I would like to continue working on the scripts and would especially like to collaborate with people who need viewers.

So my suggestion is that two or three of the viewers be added to the Three.js examples folder - perhaps in a sub-folder titled 'viewers'

Having said that, the viewers in their current state are not yet ready for production.

* The coding style needs to be brought into line with the Three..js style
* Testing needs to be carried on on a greater variety of broesers and hardware
* Effort needs to be made to get the viewers work satisfactorily on mobile devices

If you think this is a good idea, then I will start the upgrade process and create a fork with a demo folder with what I think are suitable contents.

I should also point out that I do my day-to-day coding based on the current dev version of Three.js.
So it should be a fairly straightforward process for me to keep the viewer scripts up to date.


Do you think adding new types of viewers will help Three.js continue to be different?

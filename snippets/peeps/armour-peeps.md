# Armour Peeps

Hi everyone

I am in touch with Lock Cooper, Nancy Hovey's son, who lives in Tamarindo, Costa Rica.

I have asked him to look into accommodation for up to fifteen people for either Christmas or August 2020. Lock is some way (I not exactly sure how yet) with property and tourism in the area. He also runs a wine bar, Bones/https://www.facebook.com/BonesTama/, in Tamarindo. In essence, we are accessing local concierge expertise which can make things more fun and engaging.

Nancy and Ted Cooper have visited Tamarindo a number of times and recommend a visit highly.

I have put some of their links and more here:

The surfing is good. We can make chocolate. We take a boat up a croc-infested river. And so on.

I will keep you informed of any updates.

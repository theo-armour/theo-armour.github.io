Tamarindo

What conditions or criteria make for a worthy Christmas holiday? What potential camaraderie could drag us out of our comfy houses? What possible venue can motivate us to poo-poo the issues of traveling during a holiday?

Here are some thoughts:

TL:DR Tamarindo might not be bad

Geography

-   Ocean facing beaches good for surfing
-   Estuary and protected beaches: good for snorkeling
-   Rivers: good for jungle boats trips to see crocodiles
-   Volcanoes and mountains in the vicinity: good for hiking / exploring

Concierge & experience curation service

-   Knows the prices and on our side of the table
-   Knows what doctor/clinic to see when one of the urchins steps on a sea urchin
-   Knows where to shop for fresh food and delicacies and good wines
-   Helps plan culture, history and geography excursions
-   Can organize transport for a group / airport pickups

Accommodations

-   Bedroom and bathroom for every two peeps
-   Cooking and eating area for big enough for the group
-   Eminently walkable to beach and/or town
-   OK for bare feet

Bonus Points

-   Somebody who knows youngsters with local language and English skills for the youngsters with us to play with
-   Family or old time friends in the neighborhood
-   Ways of getting out of the rich white people bubble
-   Talking to peeps in the locale who are not just serving the tourists
-   Single connection maximum flights to destination via major world airline from CDG/LHR/SFO/SBA/LAX/ATL

### Conclusion

The last times we were all together was fo Tania's 50th birthday at Chateau Brecourt in France and Isabelle and my 40/5Oth. I remember these as wonderful family gatherings that continued the traditions of all our families of origin. I would like to think that these gatherings may again now and onwards.

From my research Tamarindo - with Lock's assistance and help from Nancy Hovey - could be a likely venue for passing the tradition on from my generation and siblings onto the next generation and cousins.

1. As promised, the Colorectal Surgeon Song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N0w2rORwSc

2) I've been on Omeprazole since the beginning of the year. For the first time in decades I have suffered no instances of food stuck in my esophagus. Your recommendation significantly improved the quality of my life. Thank you.

But as with many medications there are risks:
Proton pump inhibitors: Risks of long-term use / http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgh.13737/full

What is a workable, minimal interventions? I tried Zantac for ten days, but felt food sticking so I resumed the Omeprazole. Since July I've been on a 20mg dose taken as you suggested 20 minutes before eating. When current batch runs out, I will try a 15mg dose. Might you have any observations or recommendations regarding these self-experiments?

3. We are scheduled for a colonoscopy December 14. As with my two prior colonoscopies, I plan for no anesthesia. if so, will it be OK if I get home without a helper?

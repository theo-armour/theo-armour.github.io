From _Give yourself the unfair advantage_ p240

Though it may not be readily apparent, there is a structure - some rules - underlying the Pot-Shots. First is brevity: no longer than 17 word because at the time he began formulating rules, he had already formulated many potshots and the longest was 17 words. Also, Japanese haiku poetry uses exactly 17 syllables not words. so 17 it is.

Second principle is universality: ever the intuitive global thinker, from the start he decided to avoid puns,p rhymes, word-play for reference is unique to one language or culture, and to use only simple, common, easily translated words. This put a premium on
'irony, ambiguity, subtlety, audacity, paradox and crazy logic.”

Third is originality: though they must sound like everyday speech, they must not be something said before. As Shakespeare might have said(but didn't), "the Words the thing". The illustration is incidental (though often adds greatly to the impact, given the old rule about how many words a [well chosen] picture is worth). Ashleigh's delightful illustrations are worth their weight in - words.

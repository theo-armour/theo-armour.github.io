Hi Friends of Ray

I received a voicemail from Ray at 8:20pm Thursday sent from the apartment. So for everybody listening here, Ray seems to be surviving. He is scheduled to be at the VA at 9am on Friday and he says he will take the bus. He has several appointments at the VA during the day.

I have family here and a wedding over the weekend, so my communication may be spotty. Please feel free to add any updates and words of encouragement for Ray.

Hi Ray

Thank you for your email update. It's a testament to your inner strength that the VA released you and you are home. I cannot begin to imagine the stress had gone through while having your body crumple, while being trapped in your bath, while having strangers barge in to your home while saving you. And I understand that the mind can take much time to recover from the likes of the trauma you endured.

Now that you are home, my guess is that you want to return as soon as possible to you regular routines. Even your broken elbow and the heart valve issues are not so grievous as to stop you from a desire to restart the daily routines that have served you so well to keep your mind and body together over the past few decades.

On the other hand ( not that either one of us have one handy ) as they say, "Past performance is no guarantee of future results". There may be decades of continued calm before you, There may be issue after issue in front of you. Thus you might consider using this recent very difficult experience as a wake-up call, as a call to action for a new set of routines that you are comfortable with but have a higher probability of long-term success than your current routines.

If I can give you an example of possibilities I am consider that I would like:

* Access to an ADA bathroom
* Room cleaned and laundry done
* Meals prepared or cook my own
* A bed, a desk, a chair in a private room
* Computer, phone and Internet
* Nice places to walk and be with others

In other words, I seek the abode of a monk or life in a camp or dorm. And "Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity" - Henry David Thoreau.

I can already hear you saying: "If that's what you really want, why aren't you there already?"

The reason, of course, is that I too am stuck in my own hodgepodge of little, daily rites and rituals that anchor me to a past that - quite frankly - I don't actually want to live in any more. What I do know is that  I have the intention of change. I am asking for help. I do seek assistance of others. I seek the counsel of people more experienced in the these matters than I. And the first step has been coming to the understanding that I cannot do this myself. For sure I am getting older and crazier, but I'm going to go there with a mission, a plan - and with the help and advice of my family and friends.

Ray, the next few days - weeks? - will certainly be topsy-turvy experience for you. For sure, much of the toe you will just want to tune out. But I do hope that on occasion: will you do consider what your five year plan look like? And will you share these ideas with your family and friends?

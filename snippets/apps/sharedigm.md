thoughts

Want to see
* Markdown editor
* Lots more content to play with
    * Especially for music, video, pdf and images
* Guest account could like desk of a full-time user
* Context menu possibilities?


Looks
* Breadcrumbs in status bar is nice
* Graphics look reasonably modern
* Text is clear / haven't noticed typos
* Uses require.js / Can't access the source code. ha ha.


Comments
* HTTPS: when?
* Browser: when? WebGL?
* News thing: why does it take over entire desktop and force me to save open docs
* Would be nice to use control keys for copy/paste


Target market for Sharedigm: probably small businesses.
* Can we find one or two who might be interested?
* Can we find a web site/sub-reddit/hashtag that small businesses go to

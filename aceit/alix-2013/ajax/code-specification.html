	<p>From the programmer's point of view, the requirements include: 
	<ul>
		<li>The themes are built using industry-standard theming standards and tools. 
			Generating new themes is easy and within the capabilities of most graphic designers.</li>
			
		<li>Any number of windows may be added and positioned via a simple function. 
			The default sizes, positions and other parameters of all windows may be set easily</li>
			
		<li>All the standard HTML form elements are available for use within the windows. 
				All the standard library/framework widgets and features are available in windows.</li>
		
		<li>All significant text and content is stored in simple external HTML files. 
			The external files may contain a mix of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
			JavaScript global variables from the parent window are accesssible by these external files.</li>
		
		<li>The app supports the use of iframes - providing three distinct levels of display. 
			Widgets in windows can be used to control apps embedded in iframes.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h3>Use of the Hash Fragment</h3>
	
	<p>This app uses the text after "#" - or "hash fragment" to store its data. 
		The more nnormal way woul be to use a RESTful query string or cookies.
		The benefits of using a hash fragment include: 
			not using cookies, easy to update without reloading the window and easy to save and send.
			A number of sites use this technique including Three.js, jQuery UI, Google and Twitter.
			Usage of hash fragments is not particularly well documented, so any thoughts or suggestions are appreciated.</p>

> Correction: Nov. 1, 2019
> An earlier version of this article misstated the average daily step count of the study participants. It was about 7,000 steps a day, not 3,000.


### Do you feel younger people harbor negative stereotypes about older people in San Francisco? Why or why not?

Are positive and negative valid attributes for stereotypes? ;-)

Yes. and

The 25 to 50s

* unconscious of the elderly
* treat elderly as invisible
* consider elderly are of no use
* consider elderly serve no purpose in society
* Do not get third age fourth age
* Envisage themselves as third-agers only


An interesting thing is I cn go to any bar late at night have have great conversations with complete strangers half my age. But once we go home, we never ever see each other again. Even if exchange contact data.


### Have you personally felt the sting of ageism inside or outside of a work environment? Please explain.

* Oh you're that dude! when they see on me in real life after having known me only on the internet
* After being 50 and being disabled, I never considered applying for any job ( bit involved in many failed startups)
* So conscious of ageism, I know well enough not to put myself in a position where it occurs


### Do you think San Francisco’s heavy tech presence, with a focus on innovation and newness, leads to a more pronounced ageism in the area?

* Probably yes, makes the elderly feel more out-of-touch than in other cities
* and this is probably true in any city with a specialty. See also example of Los Angeles being the center of media. the huge
* The In Crowd only looks to itself. All others are invisible.

SF is a city of you and mddle age - frequently single. Mu guess is that you would find that a higher than normal percentage of SF elderly are singles. And therefore you might also find a higher index of loneliness among the aged here.

	* Let’s Wage a War on Loneliness - The condition isn’t just depressing. It can be deadly.




### What would you tell younger people about the aging experience that might sway them from a negative attitude toward aging and older people?


* Talk to your future self
* note that you are likely to be far happier than you are now
* Visit Assisted living centers
* Note the great opportunities for elderly oriented websites and apps
* Write a will, save lots of money
* Note that most old people suck at getting old. Try not to be one of them.

## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageism

* Ageism is a form of discrimination
* "a combination of three connected elements. Among them were prejudicial attitudes towards older people, old age, and the aging process; discriminatory practices against older people; and institutional practices and policies that perpetuate stereotypes about elderly people."
* "Ageism is defined as negative or positive stereotypes, prejudice and/or discrimination against (or to the advantage of) elderly people on the basis of their chronological age or on the basis of a perception of them as being 'old' or 'elderly'. Ageism can be implicit or explicit and can be expressed on a micro-, meso- or macro-level"


### Visual ageism

## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_embodiment_theory

Stereotype embodiment theory (SET) is a theoretical model first posited by psychologist Becca Levy to explain the process by which age stereotypes influence the health of older adults.[1] There are multiple well-documented effects of age stereotypes on a number of cognitive and physical outcomes (including memory, cardiovascular reactivity, and longevity).

SET explains these findings according to a three-step process:

* Age stereotypes are internalized from the host culture at a young age.
* At some point, these age stereotype become "self stereotypes" about oneself as an aging individual.
* These self-stereotypes are then consciously and unconsciously activated to exert their effects on individual health.


## What I see

* In modern first world circumstances
* the fourth age peeps recuse themselves from participation in the day-to-day world
* Third age peeps prepare for the recusion be becoming consumeers - reading bboks, watching TV, attending performances and incessant traveling

The aged are

* Technically illiterate
* lovers of paper
* Health based on s ingle exercise
* No talk of sex
* No talk of aging health - just about the latest procedure
* Mo movement of housing

Opportunities for the aged

* Minimal opinion
* Maximum check size
* A wealth of talent is wasted

## What’s an authoritative source?

* https://www.constant-content.com/content-writing-service/2018/03/how-to-finding-authoritative-sources/

Generally speaking, an authoritative source is a highly trusted and reliable place to collect information about a topic. There are 3 common types of authoritative sources:

* Archival Sources – publicly accessible databases and documents (for example, the census)
* Recognized Sources – recognized industry experts and professional publications (for SEO, the Think with Google blog)
* Peer-reviewed Sources – peer-review publications and journals (like Harvard Business Review)

## Wikipedia:Core content policies
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Core_content_policies
	* [Neutral point of view]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view ) – All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view, representing significant views fairly, proportionately and without bias.
	* [Verifiability]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view ) – Material challenged or likely to be challenged, and all quotations, must be attributed to a reliable, published source. In Wikipedia, verifiability means that people reading and editing the encyclopedia can check that information comes from a reliable source.
	* [No original research]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research ) – Wikipedia does not publish original thought: all material in Wikipedia must be attributable to a reliable, published source. Articles may not contain any new analysis or synthesis of published material that serves to advance a position not clearly advanced by the sources.

## Wikipedia on authoritative sources

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources
	* Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published sources, making sure that all majority and significant minority views that have appeared in those sources are covered (see Wikipedia:Neutral point of view). If no reliable sources can be found on a topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it.

### Verifiability
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability
	* **In Wikipedia, verifiability means that other people using the encyclopedia can check that the information comes from a reliable source.** Wikipedia does not publish original research. Its content is determined by previously published information rather than the beliefs or experiences of its editors. Even if you're sure something is true, it must be verifiable before you can add it.[1] If reliable sources disagree, then maintain a neutral point of view and present what the various sources say, giving each side its due weight.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_wrong
	* **The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth**. There are two important consequences to this. The first is that sometimes things that are true cannot be included. The second is that sometimes things that are not true are included. The second of these is often frequently infuriating to those who know the truth. It means that Wikipedia is wrong. Due to the error of Wikipedia, it should not be considered a reliable source.
	* While at first glance that may appear like a very great problem for Wikipedia, in reality it is not. In fact, it can be seen as a good thing. Wikipedia is a project to build a free encyclopedia. Encyclopedias are tertiary sources and Wikipedia is no different in that respect. Tertiary sources collect knowledge that has already been published in what are called secondary sources. Tertiary sources do not generate new knowledge but rather just reflect what is already known and has already been published on a topic. If what has been published is incorrect then these errors will be replicated in an encyclopedia. It is not until secondary sources are published that correct these errors that these errors will be corrected in encyclopedias.

	* Editors must take particular care when adding information about living persons to any Wikipedia page.[a] Such material requires a high degree of sensitivity, and must adhere strictly to all applicable laws in the United States, to this policy, and to Wikipedia's three core content policies:

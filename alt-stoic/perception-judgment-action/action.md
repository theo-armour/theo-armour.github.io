## A Close Readings of '[What to Say When You Meet the Angel of Death at a Party]( https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/opinion/sunday/cancer-what-to-say.html )'

The following is a [close reading]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_reading ) of the above article written by Kate Bowler that appeared in the New York Times on January 26, 2018.

Here are some of the highlights of the article:

* It feels impossible to transmit the kernel of truth. I am not dying. I am not terminal. I am keeping vigil in the place of almost death. I stand in the in-between where everyone must pass, but so few can remain.
* Most people I talk with succumb immediately to a swift death by free association. I remind them of something horrible and suddenly they are using words like “pustules” at my child’s fourth-birthday party. They might be reminded of an aunt, a neighbor or a cousin’s friend. No matter how distant the connection, all the excruciating particularities of this person’s misfortune will be excavated.
*  I find that the people least likely to know the answer to these questions can be lumped into three categories: minimizers, teachers and solvers.
	* The minimizers are those who think I shouldn’t be so upset because the significance of my illness is relative.
		* Stop complaining and accept the world as it is.
		* Minimizers often want to make sure that suffering people are truly deserving before doling out compassion.
	* The second exhausting type of response comes from the teachers, who focus on how this experience is supposed to be an education in mind, body and spirit.
	* The hardest lessons come from the solutions people, who are already a little disappointed that I am not saving myself.
* Sometimes those who love you best will skip that first horrible step of saying: “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry this is happening to you.” Hope may prevent them from acknowledging how much has already been lost. But acknowledgment is also a mercy.
	* After acknowledgment must come love.
* But the impulse to offer encouragement is a perfect one.
	* There is tremendous power in touch, in gifts and in affirmations when everything you knew about yourself might not be true anymore.

### Comments

The first thing I want to do is acknowledge Kate Bowler, her existence, her possible untimely demise and her sharing of pertinent, useful and kindly observations. Hello Kate.

Kate may be about to die. This, however,  does not stop toothaches, sprained ankles and having to do the laundry. That she has set aside the time to write an article good enough not only to be in the New York Times but also to be one of the most popular articles is a good indication of the force and veracity of her thoughts and feelings.

Kate: I will do my best to come to terms with your being and listen to your thoughts.

## 'succumb immediately to a swift death by free association'

This may be the most pertinent sentence of the article: 'Most people I talk with succumb immediately to a swift death by free association.' I understand what Kate means when she calls this 'free association', but I can only find a [psychoanalytic definition]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_association_(psychology) ).

What people say is a sort of a _[non-sequitur]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_sequitur_(literary_device) )_ - which is something said that, because of its apparent lack of meaning relative to what preceded it seems absurd to the point of being humorous or confusing.

For example, somebody says they have a toothache and so everybody gets to talk about a toothache they have had while the crrent sufferer grits their aching teeth.

The typical thing is that somebody asks if your well and you reply that you are experiencing a toothache and they proceed to tell you about the toothache they had last year. I find this shift in conversation to be very common occurrence. I certainly have fallen into this deviation more than once. Unfortunately, for large numbers of people this type of reactive discussion is the primary type of discussion. Unfortunately, there's usually no Sigmund Freud person listening in who can make sense of it all.

There are 577 comments to the article. Interestingly, the majority of the comments contain the 'free associations'. Many refer to a death or prognosis of death relating to the person writing the comment. In other words Kate is absolutely correct when she says: Most people I talk with succumb immediately to a swift death by free association.

Some of the comments are of the sort that indicate 'I have endured something like what I believe you are enduring. And I just want you to know that I understand how hard and difficult such things can be. Most of the comments seem to lead into one if the three categories described by Kate.

## three categories: minimizers, teachers and solvers.

The three categories of brutish behavior that Kate describes are sublime. I feel quite certain that I have been able to create dialogs containing all three sophisms(?) in just a few sentences. I could probably talk at length about them, but the better things to discuss are what are the things one might say or do that might be constructive.

## What to do

If you see or sense that somebody has an issue or a disability then ask about it or try and say something inoffensively amusing. Children do this almost automatically. Adults should do this more often. I walk with a cane. If I see somebody else with a cane then I might say: 'wanna race?'.

Acknowledge the person and the issue. If you do nothing else just nod your head to indicate you have an understanding about what they are or have gone through.

Determine if saying that you are sorry about the situation is appropriate. If the issue is current or in the process of happening then yes. If the incident that caused the misfortune happened, say, decades ago, then words of grief and grimaces of horror are mawkish.

In either case, it may be more effective to let the person know that they appear to be handling the situation commendably.

You seem to be handling the issue well
Steer the course. Stay in charge of your destiny.

Touch the person. Open the door for them. Offer to carry a bag. Do something for them. Act.

Of course you can share your opinions about their issues, but you might learn a lot more if you ask them for their thoughts on their condition.
